The Grade I deserve is an 7,
because I thoroughly explored the abilities of GitHub and git.
 Among others, I
-created a README.md including pictures
-Put a to do list into this repository issues
-Added a license to this repository
-Added a .gitignore file to this repository
-closed issues (Lumphie/Fairytale_test)
-made multiple commits with meaningful messages (Lumphie/Fairytale_test, richelbilderbeek/pbdmms)
-fixed a merge conflict (Lumphie/Fairytale_test)
-Created more branches

Also I added a profile picture, 
became a collaborator at Lumphie/Fairytale_test,
posted an issue at a foreign GitHub (Inne-Lemstra/Bible_Reader)
forked a GitHub(christophnetz/bioinformatics_2016/2017)
Successful pull request (Lumphie/Fairytale_test, brach1/master)
Followed people,
starred a GitHub project(richelbilderbeek / travis_example_pipeline)
